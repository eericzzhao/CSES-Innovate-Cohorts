# CSES Innovate Cohorts

A hands-on workshop and lesson plan for our Cohorts members!

Git Setup
---------

First thing to do is to setup your identity. GIT will also
usually require that you do this anyways. This is so that it can
identify you to other people who also download the project.

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
